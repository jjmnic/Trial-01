Under the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM), ensuring the quality and safety of drinking water is of
paramount importance alongside the goal of universal household tap connections. Recognizing
that access to water alone is insufficient without guaranteeing its safety, the mission places
strong emphasis on maintaining high water quality standards throughout rural India. To achieve
this, each village covered under the mission is encouraged to establish its own water testing
laboratories or facilities. These localized labs are intended to serve as accessible centers for
regular and systematic testing of water sources to detect contaminants, impurities, and any
potential health hazards. This decentralized approach allows for timely identification and
rectification of water quality issues, thereby safeguarding community health. Moreover, JJM
actively promotes capacity building within rural communities by training local residents in
water testing techniques and quality monitoring. By equipping community members with the
necessary skills and knowledge, the mission fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility,
ensuring that water safety is continuously monitored and maintained at the grassroots level.
These trained individuals can carry out routine water quality checks, interpret test results, and
initiate corrective actions when needed. The combined efforts of setting up village-level water
testing labs and empowering community members to oversee water quality form a critical
component of the mission’s strategy to provide not only adequate but safe drinking water. This
comprehensive focus helps prevent waterborne diseases, promotes public health, and supports
the long-term sustainability of water supply systems in rural areas.

The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) places significant emphasis on the sustainability of water
resources to ensure that rural communities have continuous and long-term access to safe
drinking water. Recognizing the challenges posed by depleting groundwater levels, changing
climate patterns, and increasing water demand, the mission actively promotes a range of
sustainable water management practices. One of the key sustainability strategies under JJM is
rainwater harvesting, which involves the collection and storage of rainwater for future use. By
capturing rainwater from rooftops, open grounds, and other surfaces, villages can reduce their
dependence on traditional water sources and augment their overall water availability. This
practice not only conserves water but also helps in replenishing underground aquifers. Another
critical aspect is groundwater recharge, where efforts are made to enhance the natural
replenishment of groundwater through structures like percolation ponds, recharge wells, and
check dams. These initiatives help to maintain groundwater levels, which are vital for ensuring
reliable water supply, especially during dry seasons. JJM also encourages the management of
greywater, which is relatively clean wastewater generated from domestic activities such as
bathing, washing, and kitchen use. Through proper treatment and recycling, greywater can be
reused for purposes like irrigation and flushing, thereby reducing freshwater demand and
minimizing environmental pollution. Source protection is an essential pillar of sustainability
promoted by the mission. This involves safeguarding water sources such as wells, springs,
rivers, and ponds from contamination and over-extraction. Measures include protecting
catchment areas, preventing pollution from agricultural and industrial activities, and promoting
community-led monitoring and conservation efforts. Together, these integrated practices foster

a holistic approach to water management, helping rural areas conserve precious water
resources, reduce vulnerability to water scarcity, and secure sustainable drinking water
availability for current and future generations.
